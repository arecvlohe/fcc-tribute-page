          <h1>Paying Homage to Functional Programming</h1>
          <p>First let's begin with a quote from the source of all truth, Wikipedia, on what functional programming is.</p>
          <pre class='quote'>
  "In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—
  a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—
  that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and 
  avoids changing-state and mutable data."
  
  -- Wikipedia
          </pre>
          <p>The aim of functional programming, at least from my understanding, is to make programs more predicatable and therefore
            less bug prone. This is achieved through a strict set of principles and concepts. Some ideas and concepts that
            you will hear when discuccing functional programming are:
          </p>
          <h4>Data is Immutable</h4>
          <p>
            Data in functional programming languages is immutable. Meaning, you can't change an array in place. You instead transform
            those values and place them inside of a new array, essentially creating a copy but with the values updated.
          </p>
          <h4>Functions Are Pure</h4>
          <p>
            You will hear quite often that functions are pure in functional programming languages. This means the function contains no
            side-effects. Instead functions are only intended to be I/O, input/output, workers. This generally means that
            when a function is given some input, you can expect a certain output. Side-effects, such as logging to the console,
            are handled in a manner separate from the logic of the function. This is critical since creating pure functions
            is what makes your programs more predicatable, and as a side-effect :), more testable.
          </p>
          <h4>Algabraic Data Types (ADTs)</h4>
          <p>Functional programming is the convergence of math and programming. This is why you will hear a lot about terms
            that have been developed in the math field now part of your programming lexicon. You will probably hear terms
            like: monad, monoid, functor, endofunctor, and so on. This isn't intended to scare beginners away but instead
            used to reinforce and continue to use the concepts that math has solidified with proofs and peer reviewed papers.
